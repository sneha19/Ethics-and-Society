Here I have outlined several papers I have written with regards to Ethics and its changng stance in the Information Age. 
With the advent of easily acessible technology the lines between security and rights violation are thinning. With wire
taps and other data monitoring techniques where does the 4th amendment leave us in terms of personal security?

The first paper is one detailing Government Surveillence in Modern times and ponders the question of whether it is  necessary evil or simple a means to an end.

The second paper delves into Facebook's privacy policy and how it advocates people's privacy rights. The second part of the paper draws on certain ted talks and a paper written by Anderson. (Links posted below)

The third paper applies ethical frameworks like Kantianism, Rule Utilitarianism, Act Utilitarianism, Social Contract and 
Value ethics, to a specified ethical dilemma.
